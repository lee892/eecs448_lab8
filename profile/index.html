        Emmet was just a normal construction worker in Bricksburg, living alone in an apartment with his potted plant Planty. He was caught off guard on his job by a hooded figure who was searching in the construction site. He went to try and follow the hooded figure who revealed themselves to be a lady, but ends up falling down a hole. This is where he discovered and touched the Piece of Resistance before experiencing a vision and passes out.

He awakens in the custody of Bad Cop, President Business’ lieutenant, with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back. Emmet learns of Business's plans to freeze the world with the Kragle, a tube of Krazy Glue with the label partially rubbed out; the Piece of Resistance is the tube's cap. Bad Cop also accuses of him of playing dumb and says Bad Cop says that he "can’t be this stupid", to which Emmet explains that he is just a normal guy, that he has best friends that are looking for him right now, and that his friends will tell him. Bad Cop angrily turns on the television, which shows his friends forgetting that he was real and saying that he is nothing.

Bad Cop then takes Emmet to the melting chamber so they could melt him and the Piece of Resistance, but he was saved by the hooded woman who thinks he is “The Special” from the blind wizard Vitruvius's prophecy, who goes by the name Wyldstyle.

They escape from the melting chamber, and Bad Cop finds this out and orders all his men to attack them. Emmet introduces himself while Wyldstyle builds a motorcycle to escape from Bad Cop’s forces. As they were heading into the secret tunnel just past an off-limits area, Emmet reveals that he is just an ordinary guy who accidentally touched the Piece of Resistance after being asked his favorite restaurant, TV show, and song.

They arrive at the Old West, where Wyldstyle takes Emmet to the blind wizard Vitruvius disguised as cowboys. Vitruvius takes Emmet and Wyldstyle downstairs into a secret room, where Vitruvius and Wyldstyle would enter Emmet’s brain, which was completely empty. Though disappointed that Emmet is not a Master Builder, they are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of "the Man Upstairs". Before Vitruvius could start training Emmet, Bad Cop’s forces attack Vitruvius, Emmet, and Wyldstyle. They escape and stopped Bad Cop's pursuit with the aid of Wyldstyle’s boyfriend Bruce Wayne, known as Batman.

After passing by Middle Zealand, the group arrived at Cloud Cuckoo Land. There, they meet Princess Unikitty and took them to the “dog”, where all of the Master Builders are hiding and gathered for Emmet's speech. During his speech, he meets MetalBeard, a pirate with a body made of objects. He tried to infiltrate the Octan Tower with other Master Builders, but failed and barely managed to leave with his head and organs. They are happy when Emmet reveals that he has the Piece of Resistance, but they are massively disappointed when he reveals that he is not a Master Builder.

Suddenly, Bad Cop’s forces attack Cloud Cuckoo Land due to a tracking device placed on Emmet. While he and his friends plan to escape, they meet Benny, a 1980s astronaut with an addictive desire of making spaceships. To escape Bad Cop, Emmet and his friends create a submarine to go underwater, and they are successful. All the Master Builders were captured, except for Emmet, Wyldstyle, Vitruvius, Batman, Unikitty and Benny. However, as they go deeper underwater, the pressure increased and quickly destroyed the submarine. All that was left of the submarine was a “double-decker couch”, which went unnoticed by the Micro Managers and robot scuba divers. It is revealed that the group hid under the seats of the couch, where they are found by MetalBeard and brought them on their ship.

It is there that Emmet devised a plan of infiltrate Business's headquarters and disarm the Kragle. They would first enter using a ship that is the same as those of Octan's. Unikitty and Batman, using his Bruce Wayne identity, would then distract Lord Business. Benny and MetalBeard would turn off the shield protecting the Kragle, while Vitruvius would keep a lookout to see if they were being followed (although he was blind). Emmet and Wyldstyle would place the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle to stop it. Their cover was nearly blown off but was able to save themselves from being found out by singing "Everything is Awesome" that distracted the robots. Wyldstyle tells Emmet that she wanted to be "The Special", while he confesses that when she told him that he was talented and special, it was the first time he heard of it and tried to be the man she was talking about. She then reveals her real name, Lucy, to which Emmet responds with "I really like that name."

The plan almost succeeded, however Emmet and his friends ended up captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where Master Builders are forced to follow instructions. Vitruvius was able to resist Business’s forces, but he was killed by President Business himself after beheadeding him with a quarter. Before Vitruvius died, he revealed that he only made up the prophecy. Business then removed the Piece of Resistance from his back and purposely threw it at the abyss outside the tower. Before he left to destroy Bricksburg with the Kragle, he set a self-destruct protocol to leave everyone to die including Bad Cop.

They were all forced to watch as President Business destroys Bricksburg, but Vitruvius's spirit returns to tell Emmet it is his self-belief that makes him the Special. Having only a few seconds left before the headquarters self-destructs, Emmet discovers that he is strapped to the mechanism's battery and ultimately sacrifices himself by throwing himself off the edge in the tower to save his friends and the Master Builders.

Inspired by Emmet, Lucy influences many people to fight back against Lord Business. Emmet found himself in the real world as a LEGO mini-figure, unable to move. He is found by a boy named Finn, who says hi to him. Finn’s dad, better known as “The Man Upstairs” (who was in Emmet’s vision), came downstairs and saw that his son messed with his LEGO set. The boy’s dad is disappointed in Finn and starts to put everything back to normal permanently by using more Kragles.

In the LEGO world, this is an act of Lord Business’s Micro Managers rising again and defeating the citizens of Bricksburg, including Wyldstyle and her friends. Emmet notices this, as well as the Piece of Resistance on the ground, and tries to move to gain Finn’s attention. Finn then returns Emmet to the LEGO world with the piece, where he finally developed the abilities of a Master Builder, and he successfully infiltrated the top of the Octan Tower with the help of his friends. He was able to resist Business’s army of robots inside the top of the tower and confronts him, but his foot was glued to the ground by Business with the Kragle.

Before Business could finish him, Emmet said that he would use his “secret weapon”. Emmet says his secret weapon is his hand, and wants him to take it to join him. After Emmet makes a heartfelt speech to Business, he embraces Emmet, taking the Piece of Resistance and finally puts it in the Kragle. The Kragle then explodes and destroys the top of the tower, but Emmet and Business were able to survive the explosion. Wyldstyle then embraces Emmet and becomes his new girlfriend with Batman’s blessing.

However, because Bianca, Finn's sister, was invited to play, DUPLO aliens from the planet DUPLON suddenly appear, stating that they have come to destroy them, abruptly ending the movie.
